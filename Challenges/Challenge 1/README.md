# **CI CD Challenge 1**


# Challenge:

**Create a pipeline which builds and pushes a Docker image to DockerHub or ECS**

- create a basic application
- create a Docker file
- push Dockerfile and application to GitHub
- create workflow using GitHub actions that builds and pushes a Docker image to DockerHub or ECS
- set the PAT token in your secrets



# Key Takeaways
- for `docker run` command, make sure to use `-it` options to keep input open to interact with the app, and create a real terminal so prompts and output display properly.
